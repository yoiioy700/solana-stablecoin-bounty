# SSS Admin Terminal (UI Mockup)

This is a frontend UI mockup built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the Solana Stablecoin Standard (SSS) bounty submission.

## Note on Functionality

**This frontend is currently a UI Mockup/Showcase.**
While the wallet connection works (via `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`), the action buttons (like Initialize SSS Token, Manage Blacklist, RBAC Roles) are static placeholders designed to demonstrate what the operational dashboard looks like.

For full, production-ready functionality to interact with the SSS smart contracts, please use the **Admin TUI** or the **CLI** provided in the repository.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
